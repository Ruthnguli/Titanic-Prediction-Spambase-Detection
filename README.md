# 1. Titanic Survival Prediction
The RMS Titanic was a British passenger liner that sank in the North Atlantic Ocean on 15 April 1912, after it collided with an iceberg during its maiden voyage from Southampton to New York City. There were an estimated 2,224 passengers and crew aboard the ship, and more than 1,500 died, making it one of the deadliest commercial peacetime maritime disasters in modern history.

# Objective
Predict the survival status of individual passengers on the titanic accident.

# Aproach 
Randomly partition each dataset into two parts i.e 80 - 20 sets.

perform K-nearest neighbor classification.

Compute the accuracy (percentage of correct classification).

Report the confusion matrix of each classifier.

Repeat step 2 to step 4 twice, each time splitting the datasets differently i.e. 70-30, 60-40, then note the outcomes of your modeling.

Suggest and apply at least one of the optimization techniques that you learned earlier this week.

Provide further recommendations to improve both classifiers.

# 2. Spam Email Detection
Spam email is unsolicited and unwanted junk email sent out in bulk to an indiscriminate recipient list. Typically, spam is sent for commercial purposes.

# objective
Predict if the message send is spam or not spam.

# Approach
Randomly partition each dataset into two parts i.e 80 - 20 sets.

perform classification of the testing set samples using the Naive Bayes Classifier.

Compute the accuracy (percentage of correct classification).

Report the confusion matrix of each classifier.

Repeat step 2 to step 4 twice, each time splitting the datasets differently i.e. 70-30, 60-40, then note the outcomes of your modeling.
